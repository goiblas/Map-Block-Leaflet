== Description ==

The  Map Block Leaflet is designed to work with the [Gutenberg editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/ "Gutenberg Plugin"). It has been created to facilitate, as much as possible, embed maps in the content without the need to include an API key and be able to customize it visually.
